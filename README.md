# Kill Ego
>Ego is your Enemy

Inspired by [Ryan Holiday's](http://ryanholiday.net/) book [Ego is the Enemy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036528-ego-is-the-enemy).


## Usage
Install `killego` and save in your `package.json`

```
npm install killego --save
```

require it in your application
```
const killego = require('killego');
```

Now you have a variable `killego` that points to an array of statements that will make you calm down.

### CLI usage
Install the package globally:
```
npm install killego -g
```
